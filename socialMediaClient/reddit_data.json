These contracts were trading for 7.00 only one hour after I entered, meaning my 3.5k position was worth 70k. This 20 bagger will haunt me.\n\nThe strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you\u2019ve been following Tesla\u2019s dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to \n35k.\n\nOne problem: I sold only 10 minutes after opening my position for a small loss of 500$. Why you ask? I\u2019m a paper handed bitch who loses conviction in my own plays. Roast me",

There also seems to be a bit of confusion from a few of the comments. I am only up 18k as of now. Gain/Loss is equal to Total Profit/Loss on Schwab.\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nA few months ago I became convinced TSLA  was heading into the toilet not because of TSLA itself, but because I had been invested in the trainwreck dividend ETF TSLY. After my experience in TSLY, I knew TSLA   was doomed.\n\nSince the beginning of March I have thrown everything I have into TSLA puts. There have definitely been some ass-clenching nervous moments where I have been tens of thousands of dollars in the red, such as Jpow's rate cut announcement and Elon's cringey price hike stunt.\n\nBut with the utterly horrid/wonderful Q1 delivery report, it seems I am finally seeing the light and my thesis that TSLA is an overvalued dogshit car company is finally being validated\n\nI have dabbled  with covered calls and cash secured puts before, but this is actually my very first pure put play, and a very big boy one at that.\n\nLooking for any any and all advice on how to proceed with this play.\n\nIdeally I think Id hold until what will be a guaranteed earnings disaster and sell the day after, but I am worried about IV Crush, theta decay, etc.\n\nAny thoughts, input, advice is welcome.\n\nUPDATE: i sold Friday 4/5 for $30k profit. Essentially when the price was $164\n\nA bit sad bc if i had sold at the floor of $160 i would have made $100k profit. \n\nBut, I was thinking the price would go even lower and of course wasnt expecting Elons tweet pumps to raise the price up so quickly",

We have five of the Magnificent Seven reporting and big economic news:   \n\nMonday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks & commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.\n\nTuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It\u2019ll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!\n\nWednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!\n\nThursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. \n \nFriday:  The Fed\u2019s favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  \n\nIf your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA\u2019s robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I\u2019m staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.  Opinion only.",

IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I\u2019m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-carmaker-byd-launches-low-cost-dolphin-mini-ev-mexico-2024-02-28/#:~:text=BYD%20executives%20announced%20on%20Wednesday,in%20reach%20of%20Mexican%20consumers.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and own no Tesla shares.

            "body": "Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t technical analysis (I already ate all my crayons). \n\nElon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn\u2019t realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. \n\nNow TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn\u2019t even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn\u2019t been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. \n\nThat price? $500. But it\u2019s $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. \n\nThe stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That\u2019s because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. \n\nWill it close below? I don\u2019t know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we\u2019re one bad market day from the dam bursting. \n\nLong deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls. \n\nSource: r/gonewildstories (nsfw)",

Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye. \n\nWhat's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. \n\n What about this doozy of a foresight \n\n>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,\" Musk said. \"Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff. \n\nI don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the \"chips\". \n\n[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)\n\nNvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture. \n\nThe point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players. \n\nThis is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too. \n\nAnd all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people. \n\nBut there's more\n\nTesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good. \n\nIn a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.\n\nSo the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.  \n\n>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping \"some number of Optimus units next year.\"\u00a0  \n>  \n>Calling it a \"revolutionary\" product, Musk said that Optimus \"has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined.\"\n\nSo what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost. \n\nIf Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks. \n\nMatter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days. \n\nIn the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD. \n\nI do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before. \n\nI don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it. \n\nCathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor. \n\nhere's the price action and it's a sight to behold\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o17ais3kw4wc1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=57797003a6594ecdd0b09ecc540254a8be63ceec\n\nPositions - Small Short about to be a LARGE short.

            "body": "Hi regards,\n\nI am pissed. TSLA just go down and down and down everyday. I bought the dip on stock, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on calls, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on the car itself, well at least the car price stopped dipping. But only after I got the car, then I realize how good the car is.\n\nThen I asked myself, why the stock keeps going down? checked on X, everybody said interest rate is too high, demand problem etc. I was thinking, everybody around me seems fine, **Papa Powell said the US economy is robust, job market remain tight etc, overall, everything fine!**\n\nBut still... we got a problem, that's fine... but more importantly how are we gonna **solve this problem**? ads put on youtube, X, now even on facebook,so where are the demands? where?\n\nhere is what I did. I am so broke, I pulled out my phone, registered uber. Went on the road and make some $$$ buy more tsla calls.\n\n**why uber? because people who use uber are either:**\n\n1. **Does not have a car (potential buyer).**\n2. **have a car, can't drive themselves, but need transportation. (potential FSD buyer)**\n3. **Uber is MULTI-NATIONAL, regards all over the world can participate in this. If we regards can pull this off, imagine suddenly tesla uber showing up everywhere in the world overnight. Tesla gain more awareness, lead to demand picking up. I'm pretty sure they will make another movie about it.**\n4. **Get paid while doing this, Ubering in Tesla/EVs has a HUGE advantage over ICE when doing short trip. If you calculate the math, its about 13-25% more earnings. It's roughly about $23- $26/ hour before mileage deduction**\n5. if you are 100% tsla, you gonna need to drive uber to supplement some income anyway.\n\nI have done 200 trips so far. This is what I gathered from this small sample size.\n\n1. lots of people (25% at least) doesn't even know how to open the tesla door!!!! that means they didn't even get into one of the tesla yet. At least in my area, that's the situation.\n2. They LOVE LOVE LOVE the white interior and the roof, said they have never experience a car so clean and elegant! I said yeah Tesla is great, but I didn't say I clean the mess after they left everytime.\n3. Lots of people asking me about the range anxiety, their information is still lagged in 2019. they don't know how long is the battery range, they don't know how fast the battery charge at home and super charger, they just don't know.\n4. Lots of people asking me about the how does driving tesla feels like? I replied with my broken English to them, listed all the pros, cons I know of. They are very very surprised on no oil change for tesla.\n5. Lots of people still think tesla is a 60k+ car instead of 30k-40k car.\n6. Some customers specifically ordered uber green/ green comfort, I asked them why is that, they said the Tesla experience is too good.\n7. Some people's friend went tesla, they can never go back to ICE.\n\nThere are many more, but my smooth brain cant list all of them out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So in the end my smooth brain concluded that, these mfs just don't know!!!! The product is awsome@@! but they just don't know!!!! They are NOT gonna buy if they don't know!!! That's why we got a demand problem!!! Thats why the stock is dipping and dipping and dipping@@!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So I propose Mission TSLA$420.69 to all of those regards AROUND THE WORLD have major TSLA position, and have a tesla car.**\n\n1. uber, spread the words. Uber has destination mode, you can pick up some folks on your way to work/school, and on your way back home.\n2. if you know how to create website or any other way/ form of plateform, create one. and let All the people who want to participate this together register. get each driver a QR code to post on the back of the driver/ passenger seat. Beside the QR code reads something like...\"Scan here if you like to know more about my tesla experience\".\n3. uber rider then can scan QR code, sound will pop up from their phone, driver start sharing. Be objective, say the pros, but make sure you also don't left out the cons. Honesty and sincerity is the best way.\n4. also Post your referral link QR behind the seat\n5. and then we can even let the rider take some sort of survey etc. to collect some data\n6. let riders record a 10 sec vid of what they what to tell elon, if we manage to pull this off, mail it to elon\n7. we can brainstorm more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More people know about it and experience it, more Teslas will be sold. Then We go tendie town.**\n\nNot financial advise, you do you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1e1cc8uarqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50414688f9a1274e9fcc8b80031feb33af813264\n\nProof I Uber & Riders love tesla ride:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k6n64xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cd31db18cfa8dd0aef67ef206a24facaf6d4b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jezjv7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d0c94bceeadca005097cbb966e838330d508b18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvqni7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86e97eb59890f94630a5ed89b937716071967b97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rskiqaxdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2248bee3eb91d2ee59ce953889fb67e5aa71d1ba\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shubk6xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9c39de736b8565a266cb2213f98bd02ac8132c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n**if you have tesla car, go uber, tell people tesla good, people buy tesla car, we get tendies**.",

            "body": "Despite this not being financial advise, here are 24 reasons you should not go long on this stock in any way or form:\n\n1. Ceo takes Ketamine\n2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)\n3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming\n4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)\n5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)\n6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)\n7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem\n8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation\n9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth\n10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states\n11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago\n12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars\n13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)\n14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer\n15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization\n16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift\n17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique\n18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price\n19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream\n20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen\n21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore\n22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected\n23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla\n24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned.

            "body": "I see Tesla going either way, however I\u2019m leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. \n\n1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. \n\n2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it\u2019s dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it\u2019s designed for)\nEdit: saw this right after posting\ud83d\ude02 \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE\n\n3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point\u2026\n\n4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?\n\nNow of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. \n \n1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn\u2019t all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. \n\n2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it\u2019s even more bullish. \n\n3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. \n\nIn conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?\ud83e\udd14 \n\nThis is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. ",

Chinese competitors are going hard and sentiment will stay negative for at least another few weeks, till fundamentals start caching up. TSLA is going to get much better run at the US market longer term (see Ford announcement to suspend the investment in EVs), more the sentiment turns negative right now. Its lead in battery tech, software and AI, and charging will turn it into a monster money machine not far in future, but next 6 months once interest rates start to dip. Wait for stock to drop to 150 and then load up.\n\nBottomline: long term buy, but lay off for next month to allow yourselves some peace.\n\n&#x200B;",

Before you guys bomb me with hate notice that the earning expectations are very low for TSLA, with a EPS estimate of 0.36(compared to 0.6 Q4 2023).

A figure that implied the Q1 estimates would not be hit, estimates that had already been revised down). Because of that, many market participants loaded up on puts before Tuesday, and sold to close between Tuesday and today. So the delta-neutral Market Makers started closing their short positions (that they had opened to hedge) as the puts were being sold by the options buyers, resulting in the price action that we witnessed since Tuesday and which culminated in today's \"unexpected\" move. The grindy short covering between 10am and 11:40 also left many day traders trapped (who kept selling short as the stock moved upwards), which further contributed to that mini-squeeze.\n\nWould be glad to hear other opinions.

Buying DEEP ITM puts (defined as 10 dollars ITM) with an expiry of 4/26\n2. Buying DEEP ITM puts with an expiry of 5/24 or perphaps a bit longer\n\nMy questions and confusion are:\n\n1. what is more important in protecting against IV crush - purchasing ITM beforehand or having a longer expiry date?\n2. Does it matter how ITM I should be? Is there any big difference between purchasing 5 dollars ITM or 10 dollars ITM?\n3. I am confused about theta's impact on IV crush, especially since I plan on only holding my options for 1 day\n\nIf theta/time is extrinsic value, and IV crush only affects extrinsic value really, plus the fact I only plan on holding for 1 day or so, shouldn't I go with the weekly option?\n\nI have advised some people saying a longer expiry is better to defend against IV crush, but I don't understand that because longer expiry = more extrinsic value = more value to be killed during IV crush, right?\n\nEssentially, if I want to play the 4/23 earnings, and sell on 4/23, what combination of ITM + expiry should I use? How far in the money and what expiry would you advise?\n\nThanks.",

            "body": "ACHR (Archer Aviation Inc) is a market leader in eVTOLs, which are essentially electric helicopters which are emission-free, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient (some designs have wings which allow them to glide). Since they're quieter and have no emissions, they have less restrictions in where permanent landing areas can be set up. Which is why United Airlines, US Air Force, the UAE, Blade (air taxi company), etc. are also investing in the technology.\n\n  \nNow let's compare the electrification of aviation with the electrification of cars. The only appeal EVs have is that their operating costs are lower (i.e. energy and maintenance) and that they're emission-free. Other than that, they're pretty much exactly like gas cars except they're also more expensive to buy. With eVTOLs, you get those perks out of the box. Combine that with the ability to build vertiports virtually anywhere, and you get an industry ready to boom. Not to mention that ACHR is diversified, so it'll manufacture eVTOLs as well as operate its own air taxi service. In fact, I'd say that ACHR has more upside potential now than TSLA did in 2012 because of this.\n\n  \nAt this point, you're probably accusing me of comparing apples to oranges because the markets are completely different (i.e. aviation vs passenger cars). This isn't your typical long-range jet aviation though. This is urban air mobility which has short to mid range applications (e.g. airport to downtown). As use cases widen, it'll actually start taking over share of the passenger car market since commuters will turn to eVTOLs as opposed to booking rideshare and/or owning/renting cars.\n\n  \nACHR's market cap is only $1B currently, but the helicopter market alone is valued at $50B. Imagine if it captures a good chunk of rideshare, gets a contract with Amazon, builds fully-autonomous flight, etc. It could easily become a 100x investment over the next 10 years.\n\n  \nPositions: $1,500 ACHR\n\nEDIT: From reading the comments, it looks like a lot of concern seems to be around FAA certification. Here is the FAA's stance on eVTOLs: https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis. The stock is dirt cheap right now because it's not fully FAA certified yet, but there's a clear path to certification so it's only a matter of time. Once the aircraft is fully certified, risk goes down, and price will go up.",

If my hypothetical position has 50% IV, I have been scrolling that to say 40% or 30% to see how much IV Crush can affect the value\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is OptionStrat and their IV scroll/calculator tool an accurate and legitimate way to forecast IV crush?\n\nI plan on investing/gambling (lol) a significant amount of money into TSLA's earnings. I really can't risk my entire sum on silly IV crush if this websites IV tool is not accurate\n\n2. Any recommendations on other IV or pricing forecasting, if for some reason you believe OptionStrat is not the best solution out there\n\n3. Just how much IV Crush % can we expect with TSLA's earnings? Looking at Market Chameleon, it looks like at most TSLA has not experienced more than 10% IV Crush after earnings.\n\nIs this correct/accurate to assume IV crush won't be more than 10%?\n\nI'd hate to risk this significant amount of money just to blow it if for example IV crush is 20% or 30% and I am assuming 10%.\n\nBut I do not know if 20% or 30% IV Crush is realistic or not.\n\nPlease help/educate me on this. Thanks.",

            "body": "BMBL  \nCurrent price $10.3\nTarget price $18.25\nNo doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don\u2019t pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year\u2019s earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I\u2019m a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company\u2019s main expense (advertising). \n\nEA\nCurrent Price $126\nTarget Price $148\nAvg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  I\u2019ve been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  \n\nRIVN\nCurrent price $8.92\nTarget Price: $9.58+\nThis stock is now trading below it\u2019s cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells it\u2019s trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don\u2019t make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it\u2019s worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don\u2019t be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don\u2019t short this stock).  \n\nTSLA\nCurrent price $150.6\nTarget Price $294\nHonestly I\u2019m ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I\u2019ve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who\u2019s smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend\u2019s Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you\u2019ll have Tesla robotaxis.  You\u2019ll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it\u2019ll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That\u2019s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.\nThey made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that\u2019s 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I\u2019m buying this stock any price below $294.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCD, SBUX\nHonestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year\u2019s earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I\u2019m willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald\u2019s and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald\u2019s.",

He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3\u2032s 606 kilometers. The company received orders for more than 20,000 cars in seven minutes at its [March 12 pre-order launch](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/xiaomi-is-set-to-launch-its-su7-electric-car-on-march-28.html), he added.  \n>  \n>Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, he said.

            "body": " \u201cIt\u2019s the talk of the stock market: What will be the sign that the five-month rally in US equities is coming to an end. But if you ask JPMorgan Chase Co.\u2019s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, investors may not see it coming when it hits.\n\nThe Wall Street giant\u2019s chief global equity strategist warned clients on Wednesday that they could be \u201cstuck on the wrong side\u201d of the momentum trade when it eventually falters, and he encouraged them to consider diversifying their holdings and thinking about risk management in their portfolios. He also reiterated his warning that excessive crowding in the market\u2019s best-performing stocks raises the risk of an imminent correction.\n\n\u201cIt just might come one day out of the blue. This has happened in the past, we\u2019ve had flash crashes,\u201d Lakos-Bujos said in a webinar. \u201cOne big fund starts de-levering some positions, a second fund hears that and tries to re-position, the third fund basically gets caught off guard, and the next thing you know, we start having a bigger and bigger momentum unwind.\u201d\n\nHis remarks come in the final trading days of a strong first quarter for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index on track for a roughly 10% return. The broad US equities benchmark will post its fifth consecutive month of gains as corporate earnings remain strong, enthusiasm around artificial intelligence keeps building, the US economy continues to be healthy and the Federal Reserve signals its willingness to cut interest rates this year\u00a0\n\nBut to Lakos-Bujas, that list actually is a reason for concern.\u00a0\n\n\u201cA lot of goodies have gotten priced in,\u201d he said, from earnings and Fed expectations, to even a potential election victory for former president Donald Trump, which he said would be viewed as helpful for the market. Moreover, he sees few sources of upside surprise beyond Nvidia Corp. and the prospects for AI innovation. \u201cThat source of upside surprise is becoming more and more limited, and on the flipside, you do have more risks that are hovering in the background,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, looking at recent history, the rush into popular momentum stocks like the Magnificent Seven typically is followed by a correction. It\u2019s happened three times since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\n\u201cHistorically, whenever you had such a high degree of crowding it was a question of weeks before the momentum factor faced a big fat left tail unwind,\u201d Lakos-Bujas said, pointing to Tesla Inc.\u2019s 27% plunge and Apple Inc.\u2019s 10% drop this year after strong 2023s as examples of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cWho is going to be the next one \u2014 and when?\u201d he said.\n\nLakos-Bujas and other strategists at JPMorgan, including Marko Kolanovic, have been among few bearish contrarians on Wall Street this year. As most of their peers raise their US equity outlooks, with the stock market continually setting new highs, they have remained pessimistic that the gains would stick. Among the big Wall Street banks, the firm holds the lowest year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,200, implying a drop of nearly 20% from Wednesday\u2019s level.\n\nThe bank\u2019s house view on US equities has failed to materialize for two consecutive years as Lakos-Bujas and Kolanovic remained bullish throughout most of 2022\u2019s rout and then held a bearish stance during last year\u2019s 24% rally in the S&P 500.\u201d",

This 20 bagger will haunt me.\n\nThe strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you\u2019ve been following Tesla\u2019s dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to \n35k.\n\nOne problem: I sold only 10 minutes after opening my position for a small loss of 500$.

There have definitely been some ass-clenching nervous moments where I have been tens of thousands of dollars in the red, such as Jpow's rate cut announcement and Elon's cringey price hike stunt.\n\nBut with the utterly horrid/wonderful Q1 delivery report, it seems I am finally seeing the light and my thesis that TSLA is an overvalued dogshit car company is finally being validated\n\nI have dabbled  with covered calls and cash secured puts before, but this is actually my very first pure put play, and a very big boy one at that.\n\nLooking for any any and all advice on how to proceed with this play.\n\nIdeally I think Id hold until what will be a guaranteed earnings disaster and sell the day after, but I am worried about IV Crush, theta decay, etc.\n\nAny thoughts, input, advice is welcome.\n\nUPDATE: i sold Friday 4/5 for $30k profit. Essentially when the price was $164\n\nA bit sad bc if i had sold at the floor of $160 i would have made $100k profit. \n\nBut, I was thinking the price would go even lower and of course wasnt expecting Elons tweet pumps to raise the price up so quickly",

            "post_title": "Elon Musk\u2019s succession at Tesla, who might be next?",
            "body": "Hello everyone,\nIn the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.\n\nElon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:\n\n- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs\n- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)\n- prices have been lowered again in the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon\n- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/\n- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)\n\nZhu in November 2022\nThe first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/\n\nHere a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/\n\nThe CFO in May 2023\nThe name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7\n\nBoth the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)\n\nSince then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict \n- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\n- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason\n\nOf course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:\n- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?\n- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?\n- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? \n- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?\n\nSeveral articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:\n- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html\n- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570\n- \u2018At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?\u2019 The time may be right for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, suggest experts  \nhttps://fortune.com/2024/02/03/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-board-directors-corporate-governance/\n\nWhat do you think? \ud83e\udd14 \n",

IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I\u2019m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-carmaker-byd-launches-low-cost-dolphin-mini-ev-mexico-2024-02-28/#:~:text=BYD%20executives%20announced%20on%20Wednesday,in%20reach%20of%20Mexican%20consumers.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and own no Tesla shares.

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside. Taiwan based Foxconn is the make of Apple iPhone. At the Wold Imbedded Software Show in Germany Blackberry and AMD announced a strategic partnership on Robotics technology sending a shockwave in Germany and around the world.

            "post_title": "Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",
            "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)\n* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)\n* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive\n* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport\n* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [\"Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia\"](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.\n* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**\n\nIn this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)\n\nIn Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.\n\n**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** \n\nWell, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)\n\nStill, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlcvvk9a80vc1.jpg?width=1107&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee317bc8a9f6f642f8700f9f67d94014eb03a24e\n\nMusk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** \n\nThese are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:\n\n* 2024 1'950'000\n* 2025 2'280'000\n* 2026 2'750'000\n* 2027 3'340'000\n* 2028 4'150'000\n\nAs you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? \n\n First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late\n\nSecondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?\n\nThirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. \n\nFourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. \n\nIn conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !\n\n**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**\n\nDespite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:\n\n* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)\n* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)\n* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)\n\nThis is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.\n\nAccording to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2\n\nProbably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nI would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "post_title": "Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies",
            "body": "Hello everyone\n\nI am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.\n\nOne allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [\"John Barnett found dead in US\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:\n\n*\"In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.\"*\n\nHe also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. \n\nAnother Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:\n\n\t*\"A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer \u201cabsolutely\u201d has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*\n\n*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*\n\n*\u201cI have raised these issues over three years,\u201d he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing\u2019s safety culture. \u201cI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d*\n\nSincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.\n\n**TESLA'S whistleblower**\n\nOn a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article \"[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.\n\nYet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.\n\nOverall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:\n\n* Privacy data breach\n* Cybertruck details and problems\n* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)\n* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud\n\n**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.\n\n**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article \"[\"A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws\"](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate\"](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)\n\n**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: \"[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors\"](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:\n\n*Erik Larsen\\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: \u201cI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.\u201d*\n\n*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. \u201cI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,\u201d thought service technician Borja Clausen\\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\\* wrote: \u201cI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.\u201d*\n\nReuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [\"Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective\"](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) \n\nAgain, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:\n\n*\"Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts \u2013 the left and right drive axles \u2013 and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*\n\n*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.\"*\n\nA similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)\n\n**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)\n\n* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *\u201cWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I\u2019m moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it\u2019s also not as transparent about the quality of the product.\u201d*\n* accountancy of new car sales: \"*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of \u201cused\u201d cars to \u201cnew\u201d in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla\u2019s delivery numbers, they said, though they didn\u2019t try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. \"*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better\"\n* inventories value assessment: \"*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from \u201cscrap\u201d to \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.\"* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  \n\nIt seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. \n\nHandelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.\n\nWhy do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "Reddit has been flooded with bearish posts on Tesla recently. And the Musk hate boner is incredible.\n\nYes, Elon has been an absolute clown show of a CEO, and as a former Elon simp, I can\u2019t defend him anymore. He spends more time shit posting on Twitter than actually running Tesla.\n\nNow, that being said, is it time to inverse Reddit?\n\nTesla\u2019s energy division has quietly quadrupled its profits (https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/24/tesla-energy-storage-solar-profits-nearly-quadrupled-in-2024/amp/). \n\nIn terms of self-driving data, Tesla boasts 3 billion+ miles of data. I can tell you that no other company comes close to having that much data. Tesla is literally sitting on a gold mine and none of you regards seem to understand just how valuable it is.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Robotaxis are likely nowhere near completion and the regulatory red tape is probably immense. I don\u2019t foresee Tesla rolling robotaxis out anytime soon and hence, k expect a capitulation in their stock price near term. But 10+ years from now, Tesla is going to be ahead of the curve.\n\nAdditionally, projections are that 80% of new vehicles sold in 2030 will be electric. And if you think shitty Chinese cars will flood the American market, you\u2019re dead wrong. The US would never let that happen. Also, Tesla has a monopoly on the charging network. As an EV owner, let me tell you that the current infrastructure outside Tesla\u2019s network is hot doggie.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen Reddit and the media shit on Elon and he proves them wrong time and time again. Yes, he\u2019s been a complete moron as of late, but the guy is still a visionary.",

It\u2019s the worst trading week in over a year. A dramatic drop like this is always followed by a decent size bounce up. Also, huge earnings are this week with also PCE. If you zoom out, charts show we\u2019re still in a bull trend.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to bounce back up and hold over, but we will most definitely see a bounce on Monday at least, unless some more stupid shit happens over the weekend. What happens during the big earnings and PCE data will decide where we go from now on until NVDA and SMCI earnings. \n\nY\u2019all are going to get wrecked.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m fully expecting Tesla to shit the bed Tuesday, so I\u2019d expect sideways trading until then so the market can pad the beating it\u2019s gonna get then.\n\nEdit 2: seems like all of the \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are out and thinking im a \ud83d\udc02 they\u2019d like to penetrate.

            "body": "It's time boys and girls. Earnings season is back and there is one sharp knife in the collection. TSLA. Yep, the price action on this is insane towards the $150 April 26th puts. \n\nWho here has leveraged their house on a third HELOC at 9.66% to buy into the downside of this fantastic firesale? I know I have. \n\nNothing can stop this train wreck to coming to a completion after tomorrow's earnings. \n\nWhat wild and crazy thing with Elon say that can save this ship from an impending port side collapse? \n\nLook no further than previous earnings calls to get a load of what might be in store. \n\n>If interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good and if they don't come down quickly they won't be that good,\" he said. \"We have lots of people who want to buy our car, but simply can't afford it. \n\nI don't know Mr. Musk, Ford motor company is offering the Mach E for 0.00 apr financing for 72 months. Interest rates aren't coming down anytime soon so the notion that Musk can call out to full year guidance isn't even a realistic thing. Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye. \n\nWhat's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. \n\n What about this doozy of a foresight \n\n>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,\" Musk said. \"Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff. \n\nI don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the \"chips\". \n\n[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)\n\nNvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture. \n\nThe point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players. \n\nThis is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too. \n\nAnd all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people. \n\nBut there's more\n\nTesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good. \n\nIn a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.\n\nSo the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.  \n\n>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping \"some number of Optimus units next year.\"\u00a0  \n>  \n>Calling it a \"revolutionary\" product, Musk said that Optimus \"has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined.\"\n\nSo what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost. \n\nIf Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks. \n\nMatter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days. \n\nIn the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD. \n\nI do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before. \n\nI don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it. \n\nCathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor. \n\nhere's the price action and it's a sight to behold\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o17ais3kw4wc1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=57797003a6594ecdd0b09ecc540254a8be63ceec\n\nPositions - Small Short about to be a LARGE short.

Here are some key projections:\n\n**CPI:**\n\n* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.\n* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.\n* This could put rate cuts back on the table.\n* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.\n* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.\n\n**Banks:**\n\n* JPM may kick off a bank rally.\n* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.\n\n**Tech Names:**\n\n* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.\n* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).\n* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.\n* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).\n* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.\n* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.\n\n**Energy/Utilities:**\n\n* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.\n* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.\n\nThere may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!\n\nPS - Some have reached out for recommendations.  I noted some names that will be interesting to invest in here: [Today's game](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwh7qk/todays_game_strong_buy_signals_from_the_market/).  I am partial to cybersecurity as a sector, given it is likely to benefit from the overall trends I have noted.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "Hi regards,\n\nI am pissed. TSLA just go down and down and down everyday. I bought the dip on stock, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on calls, it keeps on dipping, bought the dip on the car itself, well at least the car price stopped dipping. But only after I got the car, then I realize how good the car is.\n\nThen I asked myself, why the stock keeps going down? checked on X, everybody said interest rate is too high, demand problem etc. I was thinking, everybody around me seems fine, **Papa Powell said the US economy is robust, job market remain tight etc, overall, everything fine!**\n\nBut still... we got a problem, that's fine... but more importantly how are we gonna **solve this problem**? ads put on youtube, X, now even on facebook,so where are the demands? where?\n\nhere is what I did. I am so broke, I pulled out my phone, registered uber. Went on the road and make some $$$ buy more tsla calls.\n\n**why uber? because people who use uber are either:**\n\n1. **Does not have a car (potential buyer).**\n2. **have a car, can't drive themselves, but need transportation. (potential FSD buyer)**\n3. **Uber is MULTI-NATIONAL, regards all over the world can participate in this. If we regards can pull this off, imagine suddenly tesla uber showing up everywhere in the world overnight. Tesla gain more awareness, lead to demand picking up. I'm pretty sure they will make another movie about it.**\n4. **Get paid while doing this, Ubering in Tesla/EVs has a HUGE advantage over ICE when doing short trip. If you calculate the math, its about 13-25% more earnings. It's roughly about $23- $26/ hour before mileage deduction**\n5. if you are 100% tsla, you gonna need to drive uber to supplement some income anyway.\n\nI have done 200 trips so far. This is what I gathered from this small sample size.\n\n1. lots of people (25% at least) doesn't even know how to open the tesla door!!!! that means they didn't even get into one of the tesla yet. At least in my area, that's the situation.\n2. They LOVE LOVE LOVE the white interior and the roof, said they have never experience a car so clean and elegant! I said yeah Tesla is great, but I didn't say I clean the mess after they left everytime.\n3. Lots of people asking me about the range anxiety, their information is still lagged in 2019. they don't know how long is the battery range, they don't know how fast the battery charge at home and super charger, they just don't know.\n4. Lots of people asking me about the how does driving tesla feels like? I replied with my broken English to them, listed all the pros, cons I know of. They are very very surprised on no oil change for tesla.\n5. Lots of people still think tesla is a 60k+ car instead of 30k-40k car.\n6. Some customers specifically ordered uber green/ green comfort, I asked them why is that, they said the Tesla experience is too good.\n7. Some people's friend went tesla, they can never go back to ICE.\n\nThere are many more, but my smooth brain cant list all of them out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So in the end my smooth brain concluded that, these mfs just don't know!!!! The product is awsome@@! but they just don't know!!!! They are NOT gonna buy if they don't know!!! That's why we got a demand problem!!! Thats why the stock is dipping and dipping and dipping@@!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So I propose Mission TSLA$420.69 to all of those regards AROUND THE WORLD have major TSLA position, and have a tesla car.**\n\n1. uber, spread the words. Uber has destination mode, you can pick up some folks on your way to work/school, and on your way back home.\n2. if you know how to create website or any other way/ form of plateform, create one. and let All the people who want to participate this together register. get each driver a QR code to post on the back of the driver/ passenger seat. Beside the QR code reads something like...\"Scan here if you like to know more about my tesla experience\".\n3. uber rider then can scan QR code, sound will pop up from their phone, driver start sharing. Be objective, say the pros, but make sure you also don't left out the cons. Honesty and sincerity is the best way.\n4. also Post your referral link QR behind the seat\n5. and then we can even let the rider take some sort of survey etc. to collect some data\n6. let riders record a 10 sec vid of what they what to tell elon, if we manage to pull this off, mail it to elon\n7. we can brainstorm more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More people know about it and experience it, more Teslas will be sold. Then We go tendie town.**\n\nNot financial advise, you do you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1e1cc8uarqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50414688f9a1274e9fcc8b80031feb33af813264\n\nProof I Uber & Riders love tesla ride:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k6n64xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0cd31db18cfa8dd0aef67ef206a24facaf6d4b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jezjv7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d0c94bceeadca005097cbb966e838330d508b18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvqni7xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86e97eb59890f94630a5ed89b937716071967b97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rskiqaxdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2248bee3eb91d2ee59ce953889fb67e5aa71d1ba\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shubk6xdcrqc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9c39de736b8565a266cb2213f98bd02ac8132c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n**if you have tesla car, go uber, tell people tesla good, people buy tesla car, we get tendies**.",

The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says? \n\nI hold no positions in Tesla but have a bearish view because I think their valuation is too high.",

Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)\n3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming\n4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)\n5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)\n6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)\n7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem\n8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation\n9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth\n10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states\n11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago\n12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars\n13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)\n14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer\n15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization\n16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift\n17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique\n18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price\n19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream\n20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen\n21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore\n22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected\n23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla\n24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency\n\nHere is 1 reason you might consider buying:\n\n1. Regard\n\n-------------------------\n\nPrice Target: By September \\~$100\n\nAnd now if your response is...\"call it is because inverse WSB\"...then you deserve that cute little financial grave.\n\nPositions: Bought majority of my positions they day Robo Taxi was announced. Free Money. Yeayy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo55nen453wc1.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50eda58153ce4985f0b33c884681c66ab92cb251",

            "body": "**Recap of What Happened:**\u00a0\n\nElon Musk\u2019s latest claim on Twitter was to announce the long-awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th, shooting the stock market up early 5% on Monday.\u00a0\n\nThis announcement was posted on X just after news broke from Reuters that Tesla planned to cancel the long-awaited sub-$30,000 \u201cModel 2\u201d electric vehicle once again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi.\u00a0\n\nElon Musk was quoted responding on X, saying that Reuters was \u201clying (again),\u201d even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company.\n\n**Sides Are Split.**\n\nAlthough Tesla's stock shot up, from what I can tell WSB has had very different reactions to the announcement:\n\n**Bull Viewpoint:**\n\nIf the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed, some believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla\u2019s current position in the market. If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi, then many analysts see this as a major positive.\n\nTesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one, and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla\u2019s main asset, but its self-driving robotaxi network, which is just now coming fully into focus, is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product, which would give Tesla very favorable economics.\n\n**Bear Viewpoint:**\n\nOn the other side, many believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business, labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company, metrics that have really suffered in 2025.\u00a0\n\nIn order for features such as FSD, or full self-driving, to be as accurate as possible, Tesla needs more data. To get more data, the EV maker needs more cars on the road, hence where the Model 2 comes in.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

            "body": "I see Tesla going either way, however I\u2019m leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. \n\n1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. \n\n2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it\u2019s dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it\u2019s designed for)\nEdit: saw this right after posting\ud83d\ude02 \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE\n\n3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point\u2026\n\n4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?\n\nNow of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. \n \n1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn\u2019t all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. \n\n2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it\u2019s even more bullish. \n\n3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. \n\nIn conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?\ud83e\udd14 \n\nThis is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. ",

Chinese competitors are going hard and sentiment will stay negative for at least another few weeks, till fundamentals start caching up. TSLA is going to get much better run at the US market longer term (see Ford announcement to suspend the investment in EVs), more the sentiment turns negative right now. Its lead in battery tech, software and AI, and charging will turn it into a monster money machine not far in future, but next 6 months once interest rates start to dip. Wait for stock to drop to 150 and then load up.\n\nBottomline: long term buy, but lay off for next month to allow yourselves some peace.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "Hello regards! Another regard doing yet another DD on Tesla. \n\nFirst off obviously Tesla has seen quite a fall from grace once touted as one of the magnificent seven it is one of the worst performing S&P stocks this year with losses of 30%. Despite this I believe Tesla is positioned to make a very strong come back and become a multi trillion dollar company in the near future. \n\nFirst of all, despite what other regards say, Tesla makes a majority of its revenue on car sales. With that in mind EV sales still only account for about 9% of new car sales in the US. Meaning the market for EV sales is still relatively nascent and I believe that 2024 will be a watershed year for EVs. Part of the reason why Tesla's share price has shut the bed is because their margins have continued to decline. This is in part due to inflation and also a price war with primarily BYD in China. However, recently the price of lithium has plummeted and we are now seeing this price swing begin to make it's way into the margins of battery prices. Recently BYD and CATL [announced](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/26/catl-byd-to-slash-battery-prices-by-50-in-2024-boom-evs-win/) that they will be cutting the costs of their Iron Phosphate battiers by 50% making them around 56 $/kWh well below the DOE's threshold to make EVs cost competitive with ICE cars before incentives. Although we can't say Tesla will be able to do the same I imagine this price decrease is in part due to the rapid decline in lithium prices. In the near term we can expect Tesla to increase its margins and in the mid term we can expect them to further reduce EV prices to stimulate demand. Either way the death of ICE vehicles is just beginning and Tesla has 91% of untapped US market share. \n\nSecondly, despite what Reddit has you believe Cybertruck demand is strong. Elon reported to shareholders that there is a year long backlog of Cybertruck orders and he expects production to ramp in 2024. No one knows what Cybertrucks margins will be but we can expect them to be better than other models due to experience but also due to the fact that the Cybertruck uses 48v and will have significantly less copper than standard 12v cars. \n\nFinally I know there have been a lot of empty FSD promises but version 12 of FSD truly is different and is a step change in progress toward realizing the next level of autonomy. For those of you that don't know version 12 for the first time utilizes AI from end to end. From image recognition to control and there is very clearly an observable difference which is why FSD version 12 beta is now free for one month. On top of this we can only expect FSD to rapidly improve now that the Tesla Dojo is operational. For those of you that don't know Tesla has created their own 7nm GPU with the help of poached AMD engineers. This Dojo computer will be one of the most powerful in the world by June and will be primarily focused on training Tesla's FSD. In the near term I think there is opportunity to surprise investors with a renewed interest in FSD. In the long term it looks as though Tesla will be positioned to make significant advancements on FSD and perhaps spinoff portions of the Dojo as a cloud computing service. \n\nTLDR: Tesla's price represents a period of EV weakness. Battery prices will fall significantly in 2024 making EVs cost competitive. Cyber truck production will ramp and FSD interest will grow with capability ",

After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles.

            "body": "High oil prices are creating a favorable environment for EV adoption by making EVs more attractive over ICE.\n\n1. Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.\n2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.\n3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption. This would create a rotation out of ICE cars and into EV's. This comes at a bad time as GM and Ford are scaling back EV production.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html)\n\nI think things in the middle east will escalate so will things with Russia/NATO. This will push oil prices to very high levels and will lead to a EV rush. Tesla's inventory should shrink as prices are super low.  All commodities are going higher right now. No one wants to pay $10 per gallon of gas or $100+ for a fill up each week.",

            "body": "**What Happened:**\u00a0\n\nElon Musk\u2019s latest claim on Twitter was to announce the [long-awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/elon-musk-sets-date-for-tesla-s-robotaxi-debut-amid-controversy/ar-BB1liJmi), shooting the stock market up early 5% on Monday.\u00a0\n\nThis announcement was posted on X on Friday just after news broke from Reuters that Tesla planned to cancel the long-awaited sub-$30,000 \u201cModel 2\u201d electric vehicle once again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi.\u00a0\n\nElon Musk was quoted responding on X, saying that Reuters was \u201clying (again),\u201d even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company.\n\n**Sides Are Split.**\n\nAlthough Tesla's stock shot up, Wall Street analysts are heavily mixed about the announcement:\n\n**Bear Viewpoint:**\n\nIf the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed, some analysts believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla\u2019s current position in the market. If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi, then many analysts see this as a major positive.\n\nTesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one, and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla\u2019s main asset, but its self-driving robotaxi network, which is just now coming fully into focus, is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product, which would give Tesla very favorable economics.\n\n**Bull Viewpoint:**\n\nOn the other side, many analysts believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business, labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company, metrics that have really suffered in 2025.\u00a0\n\nIn order for features such as FSD, or full self-driving, to be as accurate as possible, Tesla needs more data. To get more data, the EV maker needs more cars on the road, hence where the Model 2 comes in.\n\nGotta give credit, where credit's due: [the full story from here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)",

            "post_title": "DD on European-Chynese EV company $NIO\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa and why the the global EV industry dip has made it undervalued",
            "body": "Nio is the undervalued European-Chinese  EV \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa play to consider in this dip. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n(As of April 12, 2024, NIO shares have a short interest ratio of 4.0.\u00a0The short interest is 198,911,166 shares, and the short interest ratio is 3.90 days to cover.\u00a0The short interest % float is 14.59%.\u00a0)\\*\\*\\*\n\nIntroduction\n\nKeep in mind the recent price range: $3-10\n\nCompany Biography:\n\nNIO Limited designs, manufactures, sells electric vehicles, owns R&D centers, and operates battery swapping as a service centers in Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Germany, the U.K., People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and pending status for the U.S.A. (through Puerto Rico or Mexico). The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n* Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars\n* Offers a multitude of charging solutions\n* Offers BaaS in the European Union, mainland Chyna, and Southeast Asia (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)\n* Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)\n* Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages\n\nNow that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.\n\nMarket and Competition\n\nMarket\n\nHonestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.\n\nThe EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.\n\nIf we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.\n\nWe could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out.\u00a0Apparently\u00a0Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.\n\nBaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.\n\nAnother thing that's worth mentioning is that the European Union and Chinese governments both favor BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.\n\nCatalysts\n\nI don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.\n\n* European Union and North American Market Expansion\n* Rapid Clean Tech Movement\n* New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors\n* NIO's recent partnership with CATL and Chyna's largest automakers to produce solid state EV batteries with a longer life\n* Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but there are claims that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market. through setting up off shore factories in Puerto Rico or Mexico by 2030.\n\nLocal environment\n\nLet's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 243 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.\n\nThis all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.\n\nNow as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.\n\n* China is the\u00a0largest\u00a0EV market in the world, representing roughly\u00a050%\u00a0of worldwide sales.\n\nBetween these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.\n\nFinancials and Numbers\n\nNot gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.\n\nQ4 Positive Highlights and Outlook\n\n\u2022 Vehicle sales\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB15,438.7 million (US$2,174.5 million), representing an increase of 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 11.3% from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in vehicle sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in delivery volume, partially offset by the lower average selling price as a result of changes in product mix. The decrease in vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2023 was mainly attributed to a decrease in delivery volume.\n\n\u2022 Vehicle sales\u00a0for the full year of 2023 were RMB49,257.3 million (US$6,937.7 million), representing an increase of 8.2% from the previous year.\n\n\u2022 Other sales\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 were RMB1,664.5 million (US$234.4 million), representing an increase of 27.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022 and an increase of 0.4% from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other sales over the fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increase in sales of accessories and provision of power solutions, as a result of continued growth in the number of our users. Other sales remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\u2022 Other sales\u00a0for the full year of 2023 were RMB6,360.7 million (US$895.9 million), representing an increase of 69.1% from the previous year.\n\nInvestment Outlook\n\nAnalyst Consensus\n\nNeed a third opinion? This is one of the\u00a0biggest green flags\u00a0IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 3-10 (As of April 16th)\n\nPrice targets:\n\n* HSBC: $9\n* Morgan Stanley: $8\n* J.P. Morgan: $7\n* Deutsche: $7\n* Bank of America: $7\n* Goldman Sachs: $6\n* Mizuho Securities: $10\n\nConclusion\n\nObviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the European Union market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of\u00a0William Li, calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.\n\n-\u00a0Good growth opportunity (E.U. and N.A.)\n\n* Good market (Local environment too)\n* Good strategic approach\n* The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits\n* Huge dip (50% at one point)",

            "body": "Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain\u2019t no fun if the homies can\u2019t have none!\n\n**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV\u2019s, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. \n\nFord has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.\n\nMost recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America\u2019s #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nFord\u2019s F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn\u2019t even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.\n\n**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb\n\n**Main bullet points that got me in:**\n\n*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That\u2019s a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that\u2019s likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. \n\n*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can\u2019t tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.\n\nSource: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette\n\n*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It\u2019s like Meta\u2019s Quest 3 vs Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.\n\n*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife\u2019s boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he\u2019ll get sometime in 2028.\n\n*Huge Call OI - almost 65%\n\nSource: WeBull Options Statistics tab\n\n*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)\n\nSource: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette\n\n*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.\n\nSource: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html\n\n*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It\u2019s a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don\u2019t matter and we\u2019re all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.\n\n**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That\u2019s a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something \ud83e\uddd0\n\n**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it\u2019s possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don\u2019t hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there\u2019s no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. \n\nConclusion: \nSolid Automaker that\u2019s not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that\u2019s also now a growth stock. \n\nMy Positions: \n$14.5c x100 - 4/26\n$15.5c x26 - 4/26\n$15c x150 - 4/26\n$13.5c x23 - 5/3 \n\nSnagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n\nOther Sources:\n\n**74% increase:**\nhttps://fordauthority.com/2024/03/ford-f-150-lightning-sales-numbers-figures-results-fourth-quarter-2023-q4/amp/\n\n**Price Targets:**\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/f/analystestimates\n",

            "post_title": "Discount Stocks I'm buying: EA, BMBL, TSLA, RIVN, MCD, SBUX",
            "body": "BMBL  \nCurrent price $10.3\nTarget price $18.25\nNo doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don\u2019t pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year\u2019s earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I\u2019m a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company\u2019s main expense (advertising). \n\nEA\nCurrent Price $126\nTarget Price $148\nAvg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  I\u2019ve been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  \n\nRIVN\nCurrent price $8.92\nTarget Price: $9.58+\nThis stock is now trading below it\u2019s cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells it\u2019s trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don\u2019t make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it\u2019s worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don\u2019t be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don\u2019t short this stock).  \n\nTSLA\nCurrent price $150.6\nTarget Price $294\nHonestly I\u2019m ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I\u2019ve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who\u2019s smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend\u2019s Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you\u2019ll have Tesla robotaxis.  You\u2019ll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it\u2019ll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That\u2019s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.\nThey made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that\u2019s 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I\u2019m buying this stock any price below $294.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCD, SBUX\nHonestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year\u2019s earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I\u2019m willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald\u2019s and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald\u2019s.",

The future is no longer a topic of debate; it\u2019s unfolding before our eyes. The question isn\u2019t whether it will become a reality, but rather how soon.\n\nHold onto your hats, folks! Some out there are still waving the \"but...but LIDAR\" flag, but they\u2019re missing the memo: Tesla isn\u2019t just leading the pack; it\u2019s lapped the field. From cutting-edge tech to economic scale and sheer global reach, Tesla\u2019s got it all. \ud83d\ude80\n\nPicture this: Tesla, the grand maestro, orchestrating a financial masterpiece. Again. Imagine a world where they don\u2019t just own the Robotaxis they\u2019ve built, but they also license their magic to every other car brand on the planet. Some projections have it at $100Billion additional revenue for Tesla at almost 100% margin and 80% market share by 2030! \n\nTSLA to the moon again? or No?",
